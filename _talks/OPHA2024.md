Abstract: The difficulty of merging siloed data, especially data that includes identifiable information, is a major limitation to public health research. Privacy-preserving record linkage allows individuals to be matched across datasets using cryptographically hashed information instead of direct identifiers. We used this technique to explore how characteristics of homelessness were associated with healthcare utilization in Linn, Benton, and Lincoln counties, using electronic medical records (EMR) from Samaritan Health Services and data from HUDâ€™s Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) managed by Community Services Consortium. We were able to match 775 individuals served by both organizations in 2022 via a methodology approved by the IRB as de-identified human subjects research. By combining information across these datasets, we found that individuals with a high vulnerability index score were more likely to have two or more ED visits in 2022 compared to people with a low vulnerability index score (48% vs 36%, p=0.09), and that individuals defined as chronically homeless were more likely to have multiple hospitalizations (9% vs 3%, p<0.01) compared to patients not classified as chronically homeless. PPRL offers a practical, low-cost way to merged siloed data to better inform targeted interventions to improve population health outcomes.
