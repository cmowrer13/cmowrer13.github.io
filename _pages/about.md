I am an epidemiologist and MS student in Data Analytics at Oregon State University in the College of Health. My research focuses on applying data science techniques to public health challenges, with a particular interest in environmental health. I work closely with [Dr. Matthew Bozigar](https://health.oregonstate.edu/directory/matthew-bozigar) and [Dr. Perry Hystad](https://health.oregonstate.edu/directory/perry-hystad), investigating community noise exposure in urban environments and its potential health impacts. I am also involved in assessing the relationship between environmental radon exposure and the risk of brain and central nervous system cancers.

In addition to my academic research, I work as a consulting biostatistician with Samaritan Health Services. There, I help develop privacy-preserving record linkage methods that enable the integration of electronic medical records with data from community organizations, allowing for more comprehensive public health analyses.

I previously earned my Master of Public Health (MPH) degree in Epidemiology and Bachelor of Science degrees in Mathematics and Economics, all from Oregon State University. These educational foundations have shaped my passion for leveraging quantitative methods and machine learning to address key public health issues, especially in the realms of environmental exposures and healthcare delivery optimization.

Outside of academia and research, I enjoy staying active through competing in weightlifting and playing golf and pickleball. In my downtime, I play the guitar and am an avid reader, always exploring new ideas and perspectives.
