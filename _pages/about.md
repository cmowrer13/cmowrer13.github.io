I am a PhD student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, focused on leveraging biostatistics and data science to address public health challenges, particularly in environmental health. My current research explores how modifiable environmental exposures impact pregnancy and early human development. I am also involved in studying the association between environmental radon exposure and brain and central nervous system cancers, and investigating community noise exposure in urban environments.

Beyond academia, I have previously worked as a consulting biostatistician with Samaritan Health Services, where I developed privacy-preserving record linkage methods. This work allowed for the integration of electronic medical records with community organization data, advancing public health analyses and insights.

I previously earned my Master of Public Health degree in Epidemiology, Master of Science degree in Data Analytics, and Bachelor of Science degrees in Mathematics and Economics, all from Oregon State University. These educational foundations have shaped my passion for leveraging quantitative methods to address key public health issues, especially in the realms of environmental exposures and healthcare delivery optimization.

Outside of academia and research, I enjoy staying active through competing in weightlifting and playing golf and pickleball. In my downtime, I play the guitar and am an avid reader, always exploring new ideas and perspectives.
