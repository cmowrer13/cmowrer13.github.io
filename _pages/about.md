## About Me
I am an epidemiologist and MS student in Data Analytics at Oregon State University in the College of Health. I currently work with [Dr. Matthew Bozigar](https://health.oregonstate.edu/directory/matthew-bozigar) and [Dr. Perry Hystad](https://health.oregonstate.edu/directory/perry-hystad) on measuring and modeling community noise exposures in urban areas and investigating the association between environmental radon exposure and brain and central nervous system cancer. I also work as a consulting biostatistician with Samaritan Health Services to develop privacy-preserving record linkage methods to join data from electronic medical records and other community organizations. 

Previously, I earned my Master of Public Health degree in epidemiology and Bachelor of Science degrees in mathematics and economics from Oregon State University.

I am interested in research that utilizes cutting-edge data science and machine learning techniques to model environmental exposures for epidemiologic studies and to improve the delivery of healthcare.
