## Current Projects

### Endocrine-disrupting chemical exposures and fetal development and organ function
This study is the first in humans to examine the relationship between gestational exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as phthalates and fetal heart development and function. Our findings suggest these gestational exposures may contribute to subclinical structural and functional cardiac adaptations.

### Investigating the association between residential radon exposure and brain/central nervous system cancer
This project explores the association between residential radon exposure and the risk of brain and central nervous system cancer in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) cohort. By linking radon concentration data to WHI participant locations, this study examines whether chronic residential radon exposure may contribute to an increased risk of these cancers. This research aims to deepen our understanding of radon as a potential environmental risk factor for brain and central nervous system cancers in the United States.

### Modeling road traffic noise exposure at a high spatial resolution
Using week-long road traffic noise measurements from over 200 locations in Portland, Oregon, we developed a predictive model to estimate noise exposure levels across the entire city at a 10-meter resolution. The model integrates a range of geospatial variables, including traffic volumes, vehicle speeds, and traffic calming features, along with a novel component that accounts for the noise-shielding effects of buildings. This model provides a valuable tool for future epidemiological studies exploring the health impacts of road traffic noise exposure.

### Privacy-preserving record linkage techniques for merging electronic medical records with data from community organizations
Health data are often siloed within the organizations that collect them, making external sharing challenging due to strict privacy regulations such as HIPAA. This fragmentation limits the potential for comprehensive analyses that could drive more effective public health interventions. By developing privacy-preserving methodologies, we enable the linkage of datasets without the need for personally identifiable information, ensuring confidentiality while unlocking the full potential of big data. These approaches allow for more robust public health analyses, facilitating deeper insights into population health trends and enabling more targeted and informed decision-making.
