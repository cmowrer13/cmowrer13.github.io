In review at Environmental Pollution.

## Current Projects
### Modeling road traffic noise exposure at a high spatial resolution
Using week-long measurements of road traffic noise at over 200 locations in Portland, Oregon, we developed a predictive model to estimate road traffic noise exposure levels at a 10m resolution for the entire city. This model incorporated many geospatial variables, such as traffic counts, vehicle speeds, and traffic calming features, as well as a novel component taking into account the effect of noise shielding from buildings. This model can be used for future epidemgiologic studies of the health effects of road traffic noise exposure.

### Describing temporal trends in community noise exposures and sound sources
From a dataset containing year-long sound level measurements and audio clips, we can describe the daily, weekly, and seasonal trends in community noise levels and intermittency. These results show the temporal trends in noise exposures depend on geospatial characteristics, such as road proximity and land use.

### Privacy-preserving record linkage techniques for merging electronic medical records with data from community organizations
Health data collected on individuals are often siloed within the organizations that collect them and are not easily shared externally due to privacy regulations. By developing methodologies that allow datasets to be joined without requiring identifying information, we can fully take advantage of big data for public health analyses.
