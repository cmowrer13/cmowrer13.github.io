## Current Projects

### Endocrine-disrupting chemical exposures and fetal development and organ function
This study is the first in humans to examine the relationship between gestational exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as phthalates and fetal heart development and function. Our findings suggest these gestational exposures may contribute to subclinical structural and functional cardiac adaptations.

### Investigating the association between residential radon exposure and brain/central nervous system cancer
This project explores the association between residential radon exposure and the risk of brain and central nervous system cancer in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) cohort. By linking radon concentration data to WHI participant locations, this study examines whether chronic residential radon exposure may contribute to an increased risk of these cancers. This research aims to deepen our understanding of radon as a potential environmental risk factor for brain and central nervous system cancers in the United States.

### Validation of legacy and modern metrics for estimating residential radon concentrations
Despite their widespread use in epidemiologic research, the comparative performance of existing radon metrics for estimating in-home radon concentrations has rarely been evaluated against independently collected radon measurements. This study aims to asserss agreement, bias, and error relative to measured concentrations to inform the selection and interpretation of radon concentration estimates in large cohort studies and strengthen the evidence base for studying the health effects of residential radon exposure.

### Modeling road traffic noise exposure at a high spatial resolution
Using week-long road traffic noise measurements from over 200 locations in Portland, Oregon, we developed a predictive model to estimate noise exposure levels across the entire city at a 10-meter resolution. The model integrates a range of geospatial variables, including traffic volumes, vehicle speeds, and traffic calming features, along with a novel component that accounts for the noise-shielding effects of buildings. This model provides a valuable tool for future epidemiological studies exploring the health impacts of road traffic noise exposure.
